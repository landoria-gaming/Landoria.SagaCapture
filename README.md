# SagaCapture

Records high-definition Valheim videos with automatic switching between your gameplay view and a second camera that follows your character.

</p>

## Requirements

- Windows x64.
- An NVIDIA GPU with NVENC support and a recent NVIDIA driver.

  To check your GPU, run `nvidia-smi` in Command Prompt and find its model in the
  [NVIDIA Video Encode and Decode GPU Support Matrix](https://developer.nvidia.com/video-encode-and-decode-gpu-support-matrix-new).
  Check that `H.264 (AVC) YUV 4:2:0` is marked `YES`.

- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html), which is used to create the final
  MP4 file. It is not bundled and must be installed separately.

Set environment variable `FFMPEG_PATH` to the absolute path of the FFmpeg `bin`
folder containing `ffmpeg.exe` before starting Valheim. For example, in
PowerShell:

```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("FFMPEG_PATH", "C:\tools\ffmpeg\bin", "User")
```

## Record a video

Press `F8` to start or stop video recording.

Videos are saved in the **SagaCapture** folder inside your Windows **Videos**
folder. The folder is created automatically.

## Settings

Open this BepInEx file for recording settings:

```text
BepInEx/config/Landoria.SagaCapture.cfg
```

| Section | Setting | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Controls` | `CaptureModeShortcut` | `F8` | Starts or stops Capture Mode. |
| `CinematicCameraRendering` | `MaximumFrameRate` | `SameAsGame` | Sets `30`, `60`, or `SameAsGame`. The latter preserves active VSync, or limits the game and video to 60 FPS when VSync is off. |
| `CinematicCameraRendering` | `ShowFrameRate` | `false` | Shows the cinematic-camera FPS counter in the top-left corner. |
| `Recording` | `Quality` | `Medium` | Sets the recording quality to `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, or `Highest`. Lower values reduce file size and encoding load. |
| `GameplayCamera` | `IncludeUI` | `true` | Includes the Valheim interface in gameplay shots. |
| `Director` | `MinimumShotDuration` | `8` | Sets the minimum shot duration in seconds. |
| `Director` | `MaximumShotDuration` | `15` | Sets the maximum shot duration in seconds. |

## Performance recommendation

SagaCapture uses the current game resolution. Keep the game fast enough to
maintain the selected recording rate of 30 or 60 FPS. If needed, lower the game
resolution from 4K (`2160p`) to 2K (`1440p`) or Full HD (`1080p`). Prefer a
native resolution when performance allows it.

## Contributions welcome

CineCapture is the underlying capture project used by SagaCapture. We welcome
contributions to expand its support across more platforms, GPUs, and graphics
APIs.
